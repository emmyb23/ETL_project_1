goodreads and amazon review merged data project

For this project I extracted data from two open source data sites, data.world and Kaggle.  I wanted to obtain two different sources of data on book reviews from different sites and pull in book sales.  My original question I was trying to answer was whether high average book reviews equated to more books sold or higher profit.  I found it quite hard to find free data on book sales.  I did find a source on data.world that had been obtained from NovelRank.com before Amazon bought and shut the site down.  It is a limited set and its dated since the site was shutdown in mid 2018.  My second piece of data came from Kaggle, it contains average book review ratings from goodreads.com and information on the books themselves. 

please see the report for more details on the process.
